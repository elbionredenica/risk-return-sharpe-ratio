# Understanding the Sharpe Ratio

## Overview
This repository provides a guide to understanding and implementing the Sharpe Ratio using Python. It covers importing necessary modules, data visualization, calculating returns, and computing the Sharpe Ratio for Amazon and Facebook stocks relative to the S&P 500 index.

## Installation
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sharpe-ratio.git`
- Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Open `Sharpe_Ratio_Calculator.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow instructions to execute each code cell sequentially.
3. Ensure required data files (`stock_data.csv` and `benchmark_data.csv`) are in the `datasets` folder.

## Data
This project uses daily stock prices for Amazon and Facebook, along with S&P 500 index values, available in CSV format in the `datasets` folder.

## Methodology
- Import necessary modules.
- Preprocess and explore datasets.
- Calculate daily returns.
- Compute excess returns.
- Calculate the Sharpe Ratio.

## Results
Visualizations include daily stock prices, returns, excess returns, and the final Sharpe Ratio comparison between Amazon and Facebook.

## Conclusion
The Sharpe Ratio offers a tool for comparing investment opportunities on a risk-adjusted basis.
